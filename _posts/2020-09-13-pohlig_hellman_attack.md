## Elliptic Curves

In its more general form, an Elliptic Curve is a curve defined by an equation of the form

$$
y^{2}+a_{1}xy+a_{3}y=x^{3}+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{4}x+a_{6}
$$

over some field F.

<br>

For example,

<p align="center"><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64528476/93015416-3f3cdc80-f5f4-11ea-81c4-7866151d4ebb.png"></p>

$$
y^{2}=x^{3}-3x+4
$$

<br>

$$E(F)$$ defines a set of points that satisfy the elliptic equation in the field $$F$$.

$$
E(F) = \{(x,y)\in F^{2}: y^{2}+a_{1}xy+a_{3}y=x^{3}+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{4}x+a_{6}\} \cup \{\mathcal{O}\}
$$

<br>

$$\mathcal{O}$$ means Origin, $$(0, 0)$$. It does not satisfy the elliptic equation but it is necessary for operation. Actually, we usually use simpler curves, like the curves mentioned with example.

$$
y^{2}=x^{3}+ax+b
$$

<br>


### Group Operation

We can create a group operation $$+$$ over the set $$E(F)$$. I'll explain how to add 2 points on an Elliptic curve with image.

<p align="center"><img width="388" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64528476/93015819-7c569e00-f5f7-11ea-8c61-07da1b9fd744.png"></p>

Let's do $$P+Q$$. 

1. Draw the line $$L$$ through $$P$$ and $$Q$$. 

2. The line $$L$$ intersects the cubic curve $$E$$ in a third point. Call that third point $$R$$.

3. Draw the vertical line through $$R$$. We define the $$P+Q$$ to be the reflected point of $$R$$.

<p align="center"><img width="390" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64528476/93015869-e53e1600-f5f7-11ea-8ac6-12763874ea42.png"></p>

<br>


If you want to do $$P+P$$, line $$L$$ becomes the tangent line to $$E$$ at $$P$$. 

<p align="center"><img width="388" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64528476/93015890-1dddef80-f5f8-11ea-934a-36cbaf640c0d.png"></p>

<br>

Let's do $$P+(-P)$$. 

<p align="center"><img width="386" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64528476/93015906-41089f00-f5f8-11ea-8e13-0b8a705a4517.png"></p>

Unfortunately, $$L$$ does not intersect $$E$$ in a third point. Therefore, we should define $$P+(-P)$$. That's why Origin is necessary!

$$
P+(-P) =\mathcal{O}
$$


There is a algebraic definition of add operation but it doesn't necessary in this article so I'll skip it.

<br>


### Choice of Field

Elliptic cuves can have points with coordinates in any field, such as $$\mathbb{F}_{p}$$, $$\mathbb{Q}$$, $$\mathbb{R}$$. In this article, I will consider the attack against curves over prime fields, $$\mathbb{F}_{p}$$.

If you don't know about prime fields, see [this site](http://lkrv.fri.uni-lj.si/~ajurisic/kitk2-08/gradiva/ECClassroom/Files/BG_6.htm). ~~Actually.. If you don't know prime field yet, this article is not easy to understand...~~

## Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem

The security of Elliptic Curve Cryptosystems relies on the difficulty of the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem(ECDLP). The ECDLP is as follows:

<br>

$$
\text{For two points in an elliptic curve }Q,P\in E(F_{p})\text{ such that }Q=kP,\text{ compute }k.
$$

<br>

The fastest algorithm to compute $$k$$ currently is a combination of the Pohlig-Hellman attack and the Pollard Rho algorithm.

<br>

I usually make the elliptic curve in Sage.

```python
sage: p = 31
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [2,3])
sage: E
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 3 over Finite Field of size 31
```

Let $$P=(8, 29)$$ and $$Q=(30,0)$$.
If we want to know $$k$$, just bruteforce $$k$$, 1 to 31. 

```python
sage: Q==8*P
True
```

<br>

## Pohlig-Hellman Attack

The group $$E(\mathbb{F}_{p})$$ is obviously a finite group and it has no more than $$2p+1$$ points. The order of $$E(\mathbb{F}_{p})$$ is defined as $$\#E(\mathbb{F}_{p})$$.

```python
sage: E.order()
32
```

The Pohlig-Hellman attack simplifies the problem of solving the ECDLP in $$E(\mathbb{F}_{p})$$ to solving the ECDLP in the prime subgroups of $$\langle P\rangle$$, the subgroup generated by $$P$$.

Let $$n$$ be the order of $$E(\mathbb{F}_{p})$$.

$$
n=p_{1}^{e_{1}}\cdot p_{2}^{e_{2}}\cdots p_{r}^{e_{r}}
$$

We want to find $$k_{i}\equiv k\mod p_{i}^{e_{i}}$$ for each prime and solve the $$k$$ using the [Chinese Remainder Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_remainder_theorem).

To do this let $$P_{0}=\cfrac{n}{p_{i}^{e_{i}}}P$$ and $$Q_{0}=\cfrac{n}{p_{i}^{e_{i}}}Q$$.

Then, $$P_{0}$$ has order $$p_{i}^{e_{i}}$$ since $$p_{i}^{e_{i}}P_{0}=nP$$.

Therefore, $$Q_{0}=k_{i}P_{0}$$ and we can solve $$k_{i}$$ by bruteforcing $$1$$ to $$p_{i}^{e_{i}}$$. 

**Actually, this is not a pohlig-hellman attack yet. But it's hard to explain everything at once, so first of all, you should know that this is the extent of the attack.**

<br>

### Example 1

Although I don't exaplain the whole of Pohlig-Hellman attack, this attack can be quite tricky to you so I'll give you an example.

```python
sage: p = 37
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [1, 4])
sage: E
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + x + 4 over Finite Field of size 37
sage: E.order()
28
```

The order of $$E$$ is 28.

```python
sage: P
(6 : 2 : 1)
sage: Q
(27 : 20 : 1)
```

Let's find the $$k$$ that satisfies $$Q=k\cdot P$$. 

If we don't know Pohilg-Hellman attack, we just bruteforce the $$k$$.

```python
sage: for k in range(0, E.order()):
....:     if k*P == Q:
....:         print(k)
....:         break
....:     
17
```

Easy, isn't it? But if we make the prime field with the big prime, bruteforcing is impossible.

Now, we know the Pohlig-Hellman attack! Let's use it.

First, factorize the order. $$28=2^{2}\cdot 7$$.

Let's find the $$k_{0}$$, $$k_{1}$$ that satisfies $$k_{0}\equiv k\mod {2^{2}} $$, $$k_{1}\equiv k\mod {7} $$

```python
sage: n = E.order()
sage: P0 = (n//2^2)*P
sage: Q0 = (n//2^2)*Q
sage: for k0 in range(0, 2^2):
....:     if k0 * P0 == Q0:
....:         print(k0)
....:         break
....:     
1
```

```python
sage: P1 = (n//7)*P
sage: Q1 = (n//7)*Q
sage: for k1 in range(0, 7):
....:     if k1 * P1 == Q1:
....:         print(k1)
....:         break
....:     
3
```

$$
k_{0}=1\\
k_{1}=3
$$

By CRT(Chinese Remainder Theorem), $$k=17$$. 

<br>

Is everything OK? Let's see the real Pohlig-Hellman attack.

<br>

$$
n=p_{1}^{e_{1}}\cdot p_{2}^{e_{2}}\cdots p_{r}^{e_{r}}
$$

We want to find $$k_{i}\equiv k\mod p_{i}^{e_{i}}$$ for each prime **and we do this by representing $$k_{i}$$ such that $$k_{i}=z_{0}+z_{1}p_{i}+z_{2}p_{i}^{2}+ \dots +z_{e-1}p_{i}^{e-1}$$ and then compute each $$z_{j}$$ in sequence.**

To do this let $$P_{0}=\cfrac{n}{p_{i}}P$$ and $$Q_{0}=\cfrac{n}{p_{i}}Q$$. 

Then, $$P_{0}$$ has order $$p_{i}$$ since $$p_{i}P_{0}=nP$$.
Therefore, $$Q_{0}=z_{0}P_{0}$$ and we can solve $$z_{0}$$ by bruteforcing $$1$$ to $$p_{i}$$. 

We can get each $$z_{j}$$ by solving $$Q_{j}=z_{j}P_{0}$$ where

$$
Q_{j}=\cfrac{n}{p_{i}^{j+1}}(Q-z_{0}P-z_{1}p_{i}P-\cdots -z_{j-1}p_{i}^{j-1}P)
$$

Then CRT!

<br>


### Example 2

```python
sage: p = 113
sage: E = EllipticCurve(GF(p), [2, 5])
sage: E
Elliptic Curve defined by y^2 = x^3 + 2*x + 5 over Finite Field of size 113
sage: n = E.order()
sage: n.factor()
2^2 * 3^3
```

```python
sage: P
(23 : 50 : 1)
sage: Q
(10 : 102 : 1)
```

Let's find the $$k_{0}$$, $$k_{1}$$ that satisfies $$k_{0}\equiv k\mod {2^{2}} $$, $$k_{1}\equiv k\mod {3^{3}} $$

We can represent $$k_{0} = z_{0}+2z_{1}$$.

```python
sage: P0 = (n//2)*P
sage: Q0 = (n//2)*Q
sage: for z0 in range(0, 2):
....:     if z0 * P0 == Q0:
....:         print(z0)
....:         break
....:     
1
sage: Q1 = (n//2^2)*(Q-z0*P)
sage: for z1 in range(0, 2):
....:     if z1 * P0 == Q1:
....:         print(z1)
....:         break
....:     
1
```

$$
\therefore k_{0} = 3
$$

```python
sage: P0 = (n//3)*P
sage: Q0 = (n//3)*Q
sage: for z0 in range(0, 3):
....:     if z0 * P0 == Q0:
....:         print(z0)
....:         break
....:     
2
sage: Q1 = (n//3^2) * (Q - z0*P)
sage: for z1 in range(0, 3):
....:     if z1 * P0 == Q1:
....:         print(z1)
....:         break
....:     
2
sage: Q2 = (n//3^3) * (Q-z0*P-z1*3*P)
sage: for z2 in range(0, 3):
....:     if z2 * P0 == Q2:
....:         print(z2)
....:         break
....:     
1
```

$$
\therefore k_{1} = 17
$$

By CRT, $$k=71$$. 

If you are a good coder, this process will be simpler!

If you see my first references, `Weak Curves in Elliptic Curve Cryptography`, there is a simple code in sage. 

<br>

**Conclusion : If the order of elliptic curve has only small prime cofactors, ECDLP is easily to solve!**
