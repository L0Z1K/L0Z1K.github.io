This post refered to [O'REILLY REPORT: LEADING DATA SCIENCE TEAMS](https://saturncloud.io/get-content/oreilly-report-leading-data-science-teams/).

I am working at a start-up company, [Corcaüêã](https://www.corca.ai/), that use data science to solve business problems. I am interested in how to lead data science teams. So I read this report and summarized it.

# Introduction

<mark>There are so many challenges when we lead a data science team.</mark> We won't know how a project will turn out until it finished. For example, the data might be missing, or the data is so garbage to train, or the trained model might just not be practical. We should also defined the goal of the project well before analyzing the data.

This report is a handguide for thinking about the problems data science leaders face when running a team.

<strong>Chapter 1</strong> is about who should be on a data science team. <strong>Chapter 2</strong> is about how to manage the workflow of the team. <strong>Chapter 3</strong> covers some of the technical infrastructure decisions. Finally, <strong>Chapter 4</strong> discusses how to help the data scientists deliver value.
